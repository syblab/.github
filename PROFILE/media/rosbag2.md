                       [[Topic ...] ...]

Record ROS data to a bag

positional arguments:
  [Topic ...]           Space-delimited list of topics to record. (deprecated)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Destination of the bagfile to create, defaults to a timestamped folder in the current
                        directory.
  -s {sqlite3,mcap}, --storage {sqlite3,mcap}
                        Storage identifier to be used, defaults to 'mcap'.
  --topics Topic [Topic ...]
                        Space-delimited list of topics to record.
  --services ServiceName [ServiceName ...]
                        Space-delimited list of services to record.
  --topic-types TopicType [TopicType ...]
                        Space-delimited list of topic types to record.
  -a, --all             Record all topics and services (Exclude hidden topic).
  --all-topics          Record all topics (Exclude hidden topic).
  --all-services        Record all services via service event topics.
  -e REGEX, --regex REGEX
                        Record only topics and services containing provided regular expression. Note: --all, --all-
                        topics or --all-services will override --regex.
  --exclude-regex EXCLUDE_REGEX
                        Exclude topics and services containing provided regular expression. Works on top of --all,
                        --all-topics, --all-services, --topics, --services or --regex.
  --exclude-topic-types ExcludeTopicTypes [ExcludeTopicTypes ...]
                        Space-delimited list of topic types not being recorded. Works on top of --all, --all-topics,
                        --topics or --regex.
  --exclude-topics Topic [Topic ...]
                        Space-delimited list of topics not being recorded. Works on top of --all, --all-topics,
                        --topics or --regex.
  --exclude-services ServiceName [ServiceName ...]
                        Space-delimited list of services not being recorded. Works on top of --all, --all-services,
                        --services or --regex.
  --include-unpublished-topics
                        Discover and record topics which have no publisher. Subscriptions on such topics will be made
                        with default QoS unless otherwise specified in a QoS overrides file.
  --include-hidden-topics
                        Discover and record hidden topics as well. These are topics used internally by ROS 2
                        implementation.
  --no-discovery        Disables topic auto discovery during recording: only topics present at startup will be
                        recorded.
  -p POLLING_INTERVAL, --polling-interval POLLING_INTERVAL
                        Time in ms to wait between querying available topics for recording. It has no effect if --no-
                        discovery is enabled.
  --ignore-leaf-topics  Ignore topics without a subscription.
  --qos-profile-overrides-path QOS_PROFILE_OVERRIDES_PATH
                        Path to a yaml file defining overrides of the QoS profile for specific topics.
  -f {}, --serialization-format {}
                        The rmw serialization format in which the messages are saved, defaults to the rmw currently in
                        use.
  -b MAX_BAG_SIZE, --max-bag-size MAX_BAG_SIZE
                        Maximum size in bytes before the bagfile will be split. Default: 0, recording written in
                        single bagfile and splitting is disabled.
  -d MAX_BAG_DURATION, --max-bag-duration MAX_BAG_DURATION
                        Maximum duration in seconds before the bagfile will be split. Default: 0, recording written in
                        single bagfile and splitting is disabled. If both splitting by size and duration are enabled,
                        the bag will split at whichever threshold is reached first.
  --max-cache-size MAX_CACHE_SIZE
                        Maximum size (in bytes) of messages to hold in each buffer of cache. Default: 104857600. The
                        cache is handled through double buffering, which means that in pessimistic case up to twice
                        the parameter value of memory is needed. A rule of thumb is to cache an order of magnitude
                        corresponding to about one second of total recorded data volume. If the value specified is 0,
                        then every message is directly written to disk.
  --disable-keyboard-controls
                        disables keyboard controls for recorder
  --start-paused        Start the recorder in a paused state.
  --use-sim-time        Use simulation time for message timestamps by subscribing to the /clock topic. Until first
                        /clock message is received, no messages will be written to bag.
  --node-name NODE_NAME
                        Specify the recorder node name. Default is rosbag2_recorder.
  --custom-data [KEY=VALUE ...]
                        Space-delimited list of key=value pairs. Store the custom data in metadata under the
                        "rosbag2_bagfile_information/custom_data". The key=value pair can appear more than once. The
                        last value will override the former ones.
  --snapshot-mode       Enable snapshot mode. Messages will not be written to the bagfile until the
                        "/rosbag2_recorder/snapshot" service is called. e.g.
                        ros2 service call /rosbag2_recorder/snapshot rosbag2_interfaces/Snapshot
  --log-level {debug,info,warn,error,fatal}
                        Logging level.
  --storage-config-file STORAGE_CONFIG_FILE
                        Path to a yaml file defining storage specific configurations. See mcap plugin documentation
                        for the format of this file.
  --storage-preset-profile {none,fastwrite,zstd_fast,zstd_small}
                        Select a preset configuration for storage plugin "mcap". Settings in this profile can still be
                        overridden by other explicit options and --storage-config-file. Profiles:
                        none: Default profile, no special settings.
                        fastwrite: Disables CRC and chunking for faster writing.
                        zstd_fast: Use Zstd chunk compression on Fastest level.
                        zstd_small: Use Zstd chunk compression on Slowest level, for smallest file size.
  --compression-queue-size COMPRESSION_QUEUE_SIZE
                        Number of files or messages that may be queued for compression before being dropped. Default
                        is 1.
  --compression-threads COMPRESSION_THREADS
                        Number of files or messages that may be compressed in parallel. Default is 0, which will be
                        interpreted as the number of CPU cores.
  --compression-threads-priority COMPRESSION_THREADS_PRIORITY
                        Compression threads scheduling priority.
                        For Windows the valid values are: THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST=-2, THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL=-1
                        and THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL=0. Please refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
                        us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadpriority for details.
                        For POSIX compatible OSes this is the "nice" value. The nice value range is -20 to +19 where
                        -20 is highest, 0 default and +19 is lowest. Please refer to https://man7.org/linux/man-
                        pages/man2/nice.2.html for details.
                        Default is 0.
  --compression-mode {none,file,message}
                        Choose mode of compression for the storage. Default: none.
  --compression-format {zstd}
                        Choose the compression format/algorithm. Has no effect if no compression mode is chosen.
                        Default: .

                     [bag_path]

Play back ROS data from a bag

positional arguments:
  bag_path              Bag to open. Use --input instead to provide an input bag with a specific storage ID.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {sqlite3,mcap}, --storage {sqlite3,mcap}
                        Storage implementation of bag. By default attempts to detect automatically - use this argument
                        to override. (deprecated: use --input to provide an input bag with a specific storage ID)
  -i uri [storage_id ...], --input uri [storage_id ...]
                        URI (and optional storage ID) of an input bag. May be provided more than once for multiple
                        input bags. Storage ID options are: sqlite3, mcap.
  --read-ahead-queue-size READ_AHEAD_QUEUE_SIZE
                        size of message queue rosbag tries to hold in memory to help deterministic playback. Larger
                        size will result in larger memory needs but might prevent delay of message playback.
  -r RATE, --rate RATE  rate at which to play back messages. Valid range > 0.0.
  --topics topic [topic ...]
                        Space-delimited list of topics to play.

  --exclude-topics topic [topic ...]
                        Space-delimited list of topics not to play.
  --exclude-services service [service ...]
                        Space-delimited list of services not to play.
  --qos-profile-overrides-path QOS_PROFILE_OVERRIDES_PATH
                        Path to a yaml file defining overrides of the QoS profile for specific topics.
  -l, --loop            enables loop playback when playing a bagfile: it starts back at the beginning on reaching the
                        end and plays indefinitely.
  --remap REMAP [REMAP ...], -m REMAP [REMAP ...]
                        list of topics to be remapped: in the form "old_topic1:=new_topic1 old_topic2:=new_topic2
                        etc."
  --storage-config-file STORAGE_CONFIG_FILE
                        Path to a yaml file defining storage specific configurations. See storage plugin documentation
                        for the format of this file.
  --clock [Hz]          Publish to /clock at a specific frequency in Hz, to act as a ROS Time Source. Value must be
                        positive. Defaults to not publishing.If specified, /clock topic in the bag file is excluded to
                        publish.
  --clock-topics CLOCK_TOPICS [CLOCK_TOPICS ...]
                        List of topics separated by spaces that will trigger a /clock update when a message is
                        published on them
  --clock-topics-all    Publishes an update on /clock immediately before each replayed message
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        Sleep duration before play (loops are not affected), in seconds.Negative durations invalid.
  --playback-duration PLAYBACK_DURATION
                        Playback duration, in seconds. Negative durations mark an infinite playback. Default is -1.
                        When positive, the maximum effective time between `playback-until-*` and this argument will
                        determine when playback stops.
  --playback-until-sec PLAYBACK_UNTIL_SEC
                        Playback until timestamp, expressed in seconds since epoch. Mutually exclusive argument with
                        `--playback-until-nsec`. Use when floating point to integer conversion error is not a concern.
                        A negative value disables this feature. Default is -1.000000. When positive, the maximum
                        effective time between `--playback-duration` and this argument will determine when playback
                        stops.
  --playback-until-nsec PLAYBACK_UNTIL_NSEC
                        Playback until timestamp, expressed in nanoseconds since epoch. Mutually exclusive argument
                        with `--playback-until-sec`. Use when floating point to integer conversion error matters for
                        your use case. A negative value disables this feature. Default is -1. When positive, the
                        maximum effective time between `--playback-duration` and this argument will determine when
                        playback stops.
  --disable-keyboard-controls
                        disables keyboard controls for playback
  -p, --start-paused    Start the playback player in a paused state.
  --start-offset START_OFFSET
                        Start the playback player this many seconds into the bag file.
  --wait-for-all-acked TIMEOUT
                        Wait until all published messages are acknowledged by all subscribers or until the timeout
                        elapses in millisecond before play is terminated. Especially for the case of sending message
                        with big size in a short time. Negative timeout is invalid. 0 means wait forever until all
                        published messages are acknowledged by all subscribers. Note that this option is valid only if
                        the publisher's QOS profile is RELIABLE.
  --disable-loan-message
                        Disable to publish as loaned message. By default, if loaned message can be used, messages are
                        published as loaned message. It can help to reduce the number of data copies, so there is a
                        greater benefit for sending big data.
  --publish-service-requests
                        Publish recorded service requests instead of recorded service events
  --service-requests-source {service_introspection,client_introspection}
                        Determine the source of the service requests to be replayed. This option only makes sense if
                        the "--publish-service-requests" option is set. By default, the service requests replaying
                        from recorded service introspection message.
  --log-level {debug,info,warn,error,fatal}
                        Logging level.
